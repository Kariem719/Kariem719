        <h2 style="color: crimson;">Mobile app development can be a lucrative career path </h2>
        <article>
            <p>If there's one evergreen job title for software developers that just keeps getting greener, it's mobile
                app
                developer.</p>
            <p>This IT role usually refers to somebody who can design, <span
                    style="color:#087EE2; font-size: large;">build
                    and/or maintain mobile applications</span> for either Apple's iOS or the Android platform. There are
                other mobile OS choices – including Mobile Windows and BlackBerry – but
                they are increasingly dubious and irrelevant.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: large;"><b>Essential mobile app developer background training and skills</b></h2>
            <p>To be a mobile developer, one must possess software development skills and knowledge. You could develop
                these skills by earning an associate's or bachelor's degree in computer science or a similar discipline
                (management
                information systems, for example). You can further your efforts to master mobile app development by
                attending one or more of the
                many coding bootcamp programs springing up to train aspiring developers.</p>
            <br>
            If you plan to bootstrap into software development, these are some of the basic qualifications you'll
            need:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding of principles of secure, stable software design</li>
                <li>Understanding of the software development process and lifecycle, including the
                    design-develop-test-release-maintain
                    cycle, and long-term lifecycle support and maintenance</li>
                <li>Exposure to and understanding of some development methodology (Agile, Scrum and so forth) and
                    development platforms or
                    environments</li>
                <li>Knowledge of two or more programming languages, preferably in-demand ones such as SQL, Java,
                    JavaScript, C# or C++,
                    Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, or iOS, according to Coding Dojo</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This framework establishes the basics for working as a software developer in general. Next comes the
                topics,tools and technologies that are specific to mobile development.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: large;"><b>Climbing on the mobile bandwagon</b></h2>
            <p>
                <span style="font-size: large; color:#087EE2;">Mobile app development</span> is a little different
                from general software development. Because resources such as memory,
                compute cycles, storage and bandwidth are both scarce and precious on mobile platforms, most significant
                mobile app development occurs within the context of one mobile development platform or another.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on what platform (Android or iOS, essentially) you prefer, what kind of development work
                interests you, and where you'd like to work (or rather, for whom you'd like to work), your choices will
                be
                likewise constrained. According to Techworld, the most popular mobile app development platforms in 2019
                include
                those listed in the following table.</p>

        <p>Learning a platform takes time, effort and dedication. That said, most solution providers make evaluation or
            limited-use versions of their platforms available at low or no cost so aspiring developers can learn them.
            Many also offer low-cost or free self-study materials to help novice developers learn what they're doing and
            how to make the best use
            of such tools. (Look around for massive open online courses on some of these tool sets, such as
            jQuery/jQuery
            Mobile.) <b style="font-size: large;"> [Read related article:</b>

            <h2 style="font-size:large ;"><b>Doing the work, learning the trade</b></h2>
            <p> Specialized training and bootcamps are also available for mobile app development, as well as for the
                broader audience of software developers of all kinds. More experienced developers looking for a quick leg up in this game
                might be well served by a local bootcamp that specializes in mobile development topics, tools and languages.</p>
            <p>
                There's no better way to build skills and knowledge as a developer than by doing development work. The
                next best thing to finding a job and getting paid to learn mobile development, these short and intense learning programs
                can get developers up to speed in as little as eight to 12 weeks. But they require constant effort, long hours
                and lots of hard work. The really motivated may be able to bootcamp themselves, so to speak; others may find the
                structure and access to knowledgeable practitioners worth the price of admission.</p>
            <p>
                These learning programs also help developers understand a platform's inner workings and give them a
                chance to explore development resources in and around that platform. This includes not just help files, examples and
                training materials, but also developer forums and other online communities that spring up around popular tools and
                languages. Look for open source and other repositories of shared and freely available sample code. Not only will such material
                shorten the learning curve, it will provide ample opportunities to learn by example (and avoid reinventing thewheel).</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: large;"><b>Top Five Android and iOS Mobile Developer Skills</b></h2>
            <p>Hera are five skills you shoud have as a mobile developer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Analytical Skills.</strong>
                    Mobile developers have to understand user needs in order to create applications they want to use.
                    The ability to analyze the way people use their mobile devices is critical for a successful mobile
                    developer.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Communication.</strong>

                    Mobile developers need to be able to communicate both orally and in writing. If hired to create
                    a mobile app, they need to be able to ask the right question of the client to gain an understanding
                    of what the client
                    wants and needs. Developers also need to know how to give instructions to team members or employees,
                    as well as
                    explain an application to non-technical team members or clients. This requires the ability to
                    explain technical concepts
                    in clear, easy-to-understand language.


                </li>
                <li> <strong>Creativity.</strong>
                    As a mobile developer, you have to write clean code to create applications that are
                    user-friendly. Developers think creatively about how users incorporate their mobile devices into
                    their lives, and then build
                    applications that help them complete various tasks. This job involves not only tech skills, but also
                    an open mind.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Problem Solving.</strong>
                    As a mobile developer, a big part of your job will be to troubleshoot issues with applications
                    on Android or iOS platforms. You will have to be able to recognize various technical problems and
                    understand how
                    to resolve them.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Programming Languages.</strong>
                    Knowledge of programming languages is necessary for a mobile developer. Apple iOS developers
                    generally use Objective-C, and Android developers typically use Java. However, it is useful to know
                    multiple programming
                    languages. This will make you stand out from the other job applicants.
